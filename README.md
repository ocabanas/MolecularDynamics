# Molecular Dynamics Simulations

* Motivation

Master's computational project to learn the basic knowledege of parallel computing applied to molecular dynamics. 
The main objectives of this project are:
- Develop a molecular dynamics program.
- Once the sequential program is done, develop programs where the tasks of each loop are distributed in different processors and check the optimization characteristics for each one. 
- Analyze the speed-up and compare time execution with different number of particles in parallel program.
The execution has been perdormed at the BSC Mare Nostrum where large number of CPUs where used; we worked almost with 400 processors.

* The system

We work with a Van der Waals gas, specifically helium gas, described by Lennard-Jones potential model to approach the interactions between pairs of particles. We consider a system of N particles in a canonical ensemble (NVT ensemble) under periodic boundary conditions.
First, we create a FCC lattice taking care that there are no overlaps between particles. At this point, we can study the molecular dynamics of interest.

* Molecular dynamics

The integrator used to solve the Newton‚Äôs equations of motion is the velocity Verlet. The user can choose whether the system is in contact with a heat bath by activating the Andersen thermostat or not. During the simulation, we calculate the positions and the velocities of the system many times, obtaining its evolution.

## First steps üí°
Information to install and execute the programs.

### Pre-requisites üìã

Working environment:

```
Linux Shell and Bash
```

Sequential compilers:

```
ifort (Default)
gfortran (Must configure Makefile)
```

Parallel compilers:
```
intel openmpi (Default)
```

### Installation üîß

The programs are ready-to-use. The user has to download the repository in a local computer folder or computing cluster and configure the compiler and flags options in the Makefile.

Sequential program
```
Makefile:  configure compiler and flags variables (ifort by default)

```
Parallel program (compututing cluster)
```
Makefile:  configure the compiler and flags variables (mpifort by default)
"run_sub.sh" (1): Check the execution order ( mpirun by default)
"run_sub.sh" (2): Configure the submit options ( BSC by default)
"run.sh" (1): Check Makefile flags for ifort or gfortran.
"run.sh" (2): Configure "run.sh" number of processors.

```

## Execution üöÄ

Sequential program
```
(1) Configure the simulation parameters (INPUT folder)
(2) Execute the "run.sh" script.
(3) Collect results in the OUTPUT folder.
    The results folder name is the date-time when the task was submitted.

```
Parallel program (compututing cluster)
```
(1) Configure the simulation parameters (INPUT folder)
(2) Execute the "run_sub.sh" script.
(3) Collect results in the OUTPUT folder.
    The results folder name is the date-time when the task was executed.
```
### Program-check üîé

In the OUTPUT foler is provided a run_check subfolder with input configuration parameters and graphs. 
Put the same parameters in the INPUT files, run the program and compare the graphs; they should be similar except for a random factor.

### Main theoretical characteristics ‚å®Ô∏è

```
- Initial FCC structure in a cubic volume.
- Uniform distribution of initial velocities.
- Melting and equilibration at a customizable temperature.
- Velocity Verlet algorithm to integrate the equations.
- Andersen Thermostat to control the bath temperature.
- Pair interactions with Lennard-Johnes potential.
- Periodic boundary conditions.
- Thermodinamic results in real and reduced units.
```

## Technologies üõ†Ô∏è

```
- Fortran
- Open MPI subroutines
- Random numbers: CALL RANDOM_NUMBER(x) (no explicit seed)
- Gnuplot
- Bash shell scripts
- Computing Cluster
```
